# Hello! 
Welcome to my website. I am currently a Parliamentary Intern with the [**Parliamentary Internship Programme**](https://pip-psp.org/). I recently graduated with an Honours BA from **Western University**, where I studied political science and economics. I am currently applying to doctoral programs in political science for the 2023-2024 cycle. 

<br/>

## Research Interests
My research interests lie in the broad area of Canadian politics. More specifically, I am interested in legislative politics, partisanship, polarization, and federalism. Questions surrounding the mechanisms behind interactions between actors in political institutions and the implications of changes in these relationships in an increasingly partisan and polarized political environment animate my research.
