# Cynthia Huo (霍长欣)

<br/>

I am a second-year PhD student in Politics at **Princeton University**. My research interests are in legislative institutions, political elite behavior, and the impact of party cues on public opinion.

I received my BA in Political Science from the **University of Western Ontario** in 2023. Before coming to Princeton, I worked on Parliament Hill as part of the [**Parliamentary Internship Programme**](https://pip-psp.org/).

I grew up in Markham, Ontario and am a proud second-generation Chinese-Canadian.
