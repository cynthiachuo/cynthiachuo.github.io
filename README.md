# Hello! 
Welcome to my website. I am currently a Parliamentary Intern with the [**Parliamentary Internship Programme**](https://pip-psp.org/). I recently graduated with an Honours BA from **Western University**, where I studied political science and economics. 

<br/>

## Research Interests
I am interested in legislative behaviour, political parties, and elite polarization in high income democracies. Questions surrounding the ways that institutions impact political elites and the implications of these relationships in polarized political environments animate my research.
